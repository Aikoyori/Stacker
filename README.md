# Stacker
Minecraft mod to change the stack size of all items. For Fabric 1.17

Note: This mod has a config that defaults to 64. Change it to be whatever you like, but I do not recommend anything too far over 1 Billion (No support will be given for stacks larger than 1,073,741,823).

Requires Stacc API and Cloth Config API.
